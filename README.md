# Java 

Java is a high-level, object-oriented, and platform-independent programming language. It is widely used for building web applications, mobile applications, enterprise software, and more. Its "write once, run anywhere" capability is powered by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

### Key Characteristics of Java  
- **Platform Independence**: Code written in Java can run on any platform with a JVM.  
- **Object-Oriented**: It uses concepts like classes, inheritance, and polymorphism to structure programs.  
- **Robustness**: Strong memory management and exception handling make Java less prone to crashes.  
- **Security**: Features like a security manager and bytecode verification ensure secure execution.  
- **Multithreading**: Java supports concurrent programming to run multiple tasks simultaneously.  
- **Rich Libraries**: Extensive standard libraries for networking, file handling, and more.

### JVM (Java Virtual Machine)  
The JVM is a runtime environment that executes Java bytecode, making Java platform-independent. It interprets or compiles bytecode into machine code specific to the host system. It also handles memory management, garbage collection, and security checks.

### JDK (Java Development Kit)  
The JDK is a software development environment that provides tools for developing, debugging, and running Java applications. It includes the **Java Compiler (javac)**, libraries, and the **JRE** (Java Runtime Environment).

---

### Java Compiler (javac) and How It Works  
The **javac** compiler translates Java source code (files with `.java` extension) into bytecode (files with `.class` extension). Bytecode is an intermediate, platform-independent representation of the program, which is then executed by the JVM.

---

### JRE (Java Runtime Environment)  
The JRE provides the libraries, JVM, and other components necessary to run Java applications. It does not include development tools like the compiler. It is intended solely for end-users who want to execute Java programs.
